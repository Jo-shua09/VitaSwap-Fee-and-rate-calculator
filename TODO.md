# TODO: Make Website Fully Responsive

## Overview

Ensure the entire website is fully responsive, including buttons, text sizes, dialog modals, and modal centering on mobile screens. Use Tailwind CSS responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl).

## Steps

1. **Update Header.tsx**: Ensure navigation links and buttons are responsive (e.g., hidden on small screens, button sizes). - DONE
2. **Update FeeCalculator.tsx**: Make buttons responsive (e.g., size="sm" on mobile), ensure modal dialog is centered on mobile. - DONE
3. **Update FeeBreakdown.tsx**: Make table responsive (overflow-x-auto), adjust text sizes and grid. - DONE
4. **Update ComparisonSection.tsx**: Make table responsive, adjust text sizes. - DONE
5. **Update TrustSection.tsx**: Ensure grid is responsive (sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4). - DONE
6. **Update CTASection.tsx**: Make buttons responsive (flex-col sm:flex-row). - DONE
7. **Update Footer.tsx**: Ensure grid is responsive (md:grid-cols-5). - DONE
8. **Update tailwind.config.ts**: Confirm container padding is responsive (already set to sm: "1rem", md: "1rem"). - DONE
9. **Run dev server**: Execute `npm run dev` to start the development server. - DONE (running on http://localhost:8081/)
10. **Verify responsiveness**: Check components for missing responsive classes, especially buttons and text. - DONE (All components updated with responsive text sizes, button sizes, icons, and layouts. Dialog modal is centered with translate classes.)

## Notes

- Dialog modal uses translate-x-[-50%] translate-y-[-50%] for centering, which should work on mobile.
- Use responsive classes like text-sm md:text-lg for text, size="sm" md:size="lg" for buttons.
- Ensure no fixed widths/heights; use max-w and responsive padding.
